# Seven Segment Scan

This repository contains part of the code written for my master thesis.

## About

The code itself attempts to use OCR techniques to locate and read a seven segment display in a provided image.
For this, [SSOCR](https://github.com/jiweibo/SSOCR) and [SegoDec](https://github.com/scottmudge/SegoDec) were used as a jumping-off point.

This code was part of a React Native turbo module, though this repository only contains stand-alone C++ code.

**This repo is not meant for active use**

If you want to have access to the full code produced for my thesis, contact me and I might give you access to the private repo.
This includes the module, a React Native app used to test the module and several python scripts testing out the initial functionality.
